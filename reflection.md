Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?

Cafe Class: 
- restock()
        I decided to overlaod the restock() metho and only restock ice. Ice melts pretty quickly so I thought ice would be needed to restock more often than the other attributes.
- sellCoffee()
        I overloaded sellCoffee() by adding an additional parameter, ice. I thought maybe the cafe will sell both hot cofee and iced coffee!

House Class:
- moveIn()
        I overloadded moveIn() to take in another parameter, pet. I was thinking about people who may have pets.

- isResidents()
        I overloaded isResidents() to take in another parameter, pet. Like the method above, I was thinking about people who may have pets, and this new method can check to see if they pet is now a resident or not.

Library Class:
- checkOut()
        I overloaded checkOut() to take out two books at a time instead of one. I did this because people might want to check out more than one book.

- returnBook()
        I overloaded returnBook() to return two books at a time instead of one. I did this because people might want to return more than one book.


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I think overidding sometimes can be a little hard to understand. Especially when to add `super`. I honestly still don't know when to add it. But other than that overriding was the fun part!!
